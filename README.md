# NetGuardÂ â€“ AgenticÂ AI for Realâ€‘Time Network TrafficÂ MonitoringÂ & Proactive Threatâ€¯Mitigation

## Overview

NetGuard is an AI-powered, serverless cybersecurity pipeline designed for real-time network traffic analysis and threat mitigation. Built on AWS Lambda and integrated with SecureGPT, NetGuard automates the entire security workflowâ€”from ingesting network logs and correlating them with known anomalies, to enriching them using GPT-based intelligence and generating JIRA tickets for high-severity threats. The system leverages modular agents that ensure scalability, compliance with NIST SP 800-53 standards, and adaptability to evolving threat landscapes. By combining cloud-native infrastructure, anomaly detection, and large language model reasoning, NetGuard transforms raw packet data into actionable threat intelligenceâ€”enabling proactive, intelligent, and auditable cyber defense


## ðŸ§ª Datasets Used
- `network_packets.csv`: Simulated network traffic with fields like Protocol, Flags, PacketSize, Status
- `anomaly_logs.csv`: Generated by Faker with AnomalyType, LogLevel, NISTReference
- `NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf`: Grounding document for SecureGPT

  
## ðŸ§© System Architecture
![System Architecture](Resources/diagrams/Architecture.png)
NetGuard is composed of four core Lambda agents deployed in a serverless pipeline:

- **Agent 1 - NetGuard Ingestor**: S3-triggered Lambda that preprocesses and chunks raw traffic files.
- **Agent 2 - NetGuard Analyzer**: Matches logs with anomalies and invokes SecureGPT for enrichment.
- **Agent 3 - NetGuard Aggregator**: Merges chunked outputs into a unified final log.
- **Agent 4 - Ticket Generator**: Automatically creates JIRA tickets for critical threats.

All enriched outputs are uploaded to Cyber Vision for dashboard integration.

## ðŸ¤– Agent Breakdown

### 1. `NetGuard Ingestor`
- **Trigger**: S3 event (new file uploaded)
- **Tasks**: Normalize, chunk, and store logs
- **Output**: 100-row CSV chunks in `netguard-analyzed-chunks/`

### 2. `NetGuard Analyzer`
- **Input**: Chunked packets + anomaly logs
- **Logic**:
  - Match IPs with anomaly logs
  - Construct structured SecureGPT prompt
  - Receive: ThreatSeverity, ActionTaken, Explanation
- **Output**: Enriched CSV

### 3. `NetGuard Aggregator`
- **Input**: Analyzed chunks
- **Tasks**: Validate, concatenate, and export full report
- **Output**: Final threat log in `netguard-final-output-logs/`

### 4. `NetGuard Ticket Generator`
- **Trigger**: New file in final output bucket
- **Logic**:
  - Filter High/Critical threats
  - Push JIRA tickets via API

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Evaluation
| Dataset Size | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 3000 rows    | 90.9%    | 92.4%     | 96.6%  | 94.5%    | 0.93    |
| 6000 rows    | 94.5%    | 91.6%     | 89.9%  | 90.8%    | 0.92    |

- **Post-Reflexion Improvements**: Reflexive updates improved precision.
- **Load Handling**: Parallel chunking & SecureGPT invocation scaled efficiently.
