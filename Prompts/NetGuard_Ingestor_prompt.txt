Write a Python AWS Lambda function called NetGuard_Ingestor. This function is responsible for preprocessing uploaded network logs by validating the file and splitting it into manageable chunks for further analysis.

Detailed Responsibilities:
• Accept an S3 event triggered by file upload to NETWORK_TRAFFIC_BUCKET.
• Read the uploaded file (either CSV or JSON).
• Validate that the file:
  – Is not empty.
  – Contains required columns: sourceip, destinationip.
• Normalize all column names (lowercase, trimmed, no spaces).

Chunking Rules:
≤ 100 rows  → 1 chunk  
101 – 999   → 5 chunks  
≥ 1000      → fixed size of 200 rows per chunk

For each chunk:
• Save it to CHUNKS_BUCKET/chunks/ with a timestamped name.
• Return all generated chunk keys.

Best Practices:
• Use pandas, datetime, zoneinfo, uuid, and StringIO.
• Use ZoneInfo("America/New_York") for timestamps.
• Log missing fields, file errors, and column inconsistencies.
