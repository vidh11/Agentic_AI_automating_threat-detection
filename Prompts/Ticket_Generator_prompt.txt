Design a Lambda function called Ticket_Generator. Its job is to convert the final enriched report from FINAL_OUTPUT_BUCKET into JIRA security tickets for all high and critical severity threats.

Responsibilities:
1. Load final_output_key CSV from S3.
2. For each row:
   • If ThreatSeverity is High or Critical:
     – Compose a JIRA payload:
       summary: Threat with IP info
       description: source/destination IPs, threat explanation, action taken, NIST reference
     – Skip low/medium severity records.
     – Submit the ticket to JIRA via REST API using:
       JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN, JIRA_PROJECT_KEY, JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE, JIRA_DOMAIN
3. Log success or failure per ticket.
4. Return number of tickets created vs skipped.

Technical Considerations:
• Use requests, pandas, json, StringIO, boto3.
• Include authentication and handle HTTP 401, 403 errors.
• Add defensive logging and fail‑safes for incomplete rows.
