Build a Python Lambda function called NetGuard_Aggregator that merges all chunk-level threat reports into a single final output file.

Responsibilities:
• Accept partial_keys (list of chunk result files) via event.
• Load each file from ANALYZED_CHUNKS_BUCKET/temp_analysis/.
• Concatenate all partial DataFrames into one.
• Save the result to FINAL_OUTPUT_BUCKET/final/ with a timestamped filename.
• Delete temporary analysis files and optionally delete raw chunk files if temp_chunk_keys are provided.
• Return the final_output_key.

Additional Info:
• Use pandas, zoneinfo, and StringIO.
• Include logging and validation to avoid merging empty or malformed files.
